# ENI Magazine App - Code Review and Improvement Recommendations

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Base64 Image Handling
- ✅ Successfully modified `docx_parser.py` to save images to disk instead of returning base64-encoded strings
- ✅ Updated `save_preview_image` to work directly with binary data
- ✅ Modified `display_image` function in `app.py` to handle both file paths and base64 strings (for backward compatibility)

### 2. Session State Management
- ✅ Created `clean_session_state.py` to remove base64 images and large text content from session state
- ✅ Created `check_state_size.py` to monitor session state file sizes and trigger cleanup when needed

## Issues Found

### 1. Inconsistent Image Handling
- The app still uses a mix of file paths and base64 encoding - some code paths create base64 images
- In `process_file`, there's still code that reads images and converts them to base64

### 2. Code Structure Issues
- Indentation errors in `batch_processor` function causing linter errors
- Multiple missing exception handlers in try blocks
- Duplicated code blocks (e.g., required fields checking is repeated 3 times in `process_file`)

### 3. Memory Management
- Large data structures are still being stored in the session state
- The `file_data_list` contains redundant information (full text content)
- Dataframes are stored both in session state and CSV files

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

### 1. Fix `batch_processor` Function
The `batch_processor` function has significant indentation issues that need to be resolved. This function is critical for processing multiple files.

### 2. Complete Image Handling Transition
- Remove all remaining base64 conversion code from `process_file`
- Update UI components to work exclusively with file paths
- Create a dedicated image serving endpoint or use Streamlit's native file handling

### 3. Optimize Memory Usage
- Store only metadata in session state, not full document content
- Load text content on demand from files rather than keeping in memory
- Use a database for persistent storage instead of CSV files

### 4. Code Structure Improvements
- Refactor duplicate code into helper functions
- Fix indentation issues and linter errors
- Add proper exception handling in all try blocks

### 5. Application Architecture
- Consider separating the backend processing from the Streamlit UI
- Implement a proper database (SQLite, PostgreSQL) for metadata storage
- Add proper logging instead of using print statements

### 6. Batch Processing Enhancements
- Implement a proper task queue (Redis, Celery) for more reliable processing
- Add job monitoring and recovery from failures
- Use a worker pool for parallel processing

## Critical Issues to Address First

1. Fix the indentation errors in `batch_processor` function
2. Complete the transition from base64 to file paths for all image handling
3. Add proper exception handling to all try blocks
4. Remove redundant text content storage from session state
